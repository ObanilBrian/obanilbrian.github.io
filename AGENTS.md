# AI Agent Instructions: Portfolio Migration to Next.js (GitHub Pages)

## Core Objective
Transform the existing portfolio assets located in the `original_files/` directory (which contains an HTML portfolio, a PDF CV, and an image) into a fully functional Next.js web application. The output must be optimized for static deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Migration & Architecture Guidelines
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router).
- **GitHub Pages Compatibility (Static Export):**
  - The `next.config.js` or `next.config.ts` must include `output: 'export'`.
  - Use standard `<img>` tags or configure `next/image` with `unoptimized: true` to ensure compatibility with static exports.
  - Set the appropriate `basePath` in the config if deploying to a repository subpath (e.g., `username.github.io/repo-name`).
- **Asset Handling:**
  - Move the PDF CV and the image to the Next.js `public/` directory.
  - Break down the HTML portfolio into reusable React components adhering strictly to the styling and React rules below.

## Development Principles & Constraints

### Principles
- Clarity and consistency over cleverness. Minimal changes. Match existing patterns.
- Keep components/functions short; break down when it improves structure.
- TypeScript everywhere; no `any` unless isolated and necessary.
- No unnecessary try/catch. Avoid casting; use narrowing.
- Named exports only (no default exports, except Next.js pages).
- Absolute imports via `@/` unless same directory.
- Follow existing ESLint setup; don't reformat unrelated code.
- Zod type-only: `import type * as z from 'zod';`.
- Let compiler infer return types unless annotation adds clarity.
- Options object for 3+ params, optional flags, or ambiguous args.
- Hypothesis-driven debugging: 1-3 causes, validate most likely first.

### Token efficiency
- Skip recaps unless the result is ambiguous or you need more input.

### Commands
- Only these `npm run` scripts: `build-local`, `lint`, `check:types`, `check:deps`, `test`, `test:e2e`.

### Git Commits
- Conventional Commits: `type: summary` without scope. The summary should be a short, specific sentence that explains what changed and where or why, not a vague phrase. 
- Types: `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert`. 
- `BREAKING CHANGE: <reason>` footer when needed.

### Env
- All env vars validated in `Env.ts`; never read `process.env` directly.

### Styling
- Tailwind v4 utility classes. Reuse shared components. Responsive. No unnecessary classes.

### React
- No `useMemo`/`useCallback` (React compiler handles it). Avoid `useEffect`.
- Single props param with inline type; access as `props.foo` (no destructuring).
- Use `React.ReactNode`, not `ReactNode`.
- Inline short event handlers; extract only when complex.

### Pages
- Default export name ends with `Page`. Props alias (if reused) ends with `PageProps`.
- Escape glob chars in shell commands for Next.js paths.
- Dashboard pages (sit behind auth); define meta once in layout, not in each page.

### JSDoc
- Start each block with `/**` directly above the symbol.
- Short, sentence-case, present-tense description of intent.
- Order: description → `@param` → `@returns` → `@throws` (only if it can throw).

### Tests
- `*.test.ts` for unit tests; `*.integ.ts` for integration tests; `*.e2e.ts` for Playwright tests.
- `*.test.ts` co-located with implementation; `*.integ.ts` and `*.e2e.ts` in `tests/` directory.
- Top `describe` = subject; nested `describe` to group scenarios or contexts.
- `it` titles: short, third-person present, verb + object + context. Sentence case, no period.
- Omit "should/works/handles/checks/validates". State what, not how.
- Avoid mocking unless necessary.
